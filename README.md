<h1>Face Emotion Recognition using TinyML</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Facial expressions are a crucial aspect of nonverbal communication, conveying a wide range of emotions. Numerous studies have been conducted to classify these facial expressions, and there is strong evidence supporting the universality of seven basic emotions: neutral, happy, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise. Detecting and recognizing these emotions from facial expressions has significant applications in the fields of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. By automatically analyzing facial emotions, these fields aim to understand human sentiments and improve human-computer interaction.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop a face emotion recognition system using TinyML. TinyML is a cutting-edge approach that enables the deployment of machine learning models on resource-constrained devices, such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. By leveraging TinyML, we can create a compact and efficient model capable of accurately detecting and classifying facial emotions in real-time.</p>

<h2>Model Building Dependencies</h2>
<p>To build the face emotion recognition model, the following dependencies are required:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3: The programming language used for model development and training.</li>
  <li>TensorFlow 2.0: An open-source machine learning framework for building and deploying models.</li>
  <li>Keras: A high-level neural networks API that serves as the interface for building the model architecture.</li>
  <li>TensorFlow Lite: A lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for mobile and embedded devices.</li>
  <li>Edge Impulse: A platform that simplifies the process of collecting data, training models, and deploying them on edge devices.</li>
  <li>TinyML: A subset of machine learning techniques optimized for resource-constrained environments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The face emotion recognition model is developed using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Data Collection: A dataset containing images of faces expressing different emotions is collected. The dataset should include a sufficient number of examples for each emotion category.</li>
  <li>Data Preprocessing: The collected images are preprocessed to ensure consistency and compatibility with the model. This may involve resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and converting the images to a suitable format.</li>
  <li>Model Architecture: A deep learning model architecture is designed to learn and classify facial emotions. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image-based tasks, and they can be employed in this project to extract relevant features from the facial images.</li>
  <li>Model Training: The preprocessed dataset is split into training and validation sets. The model is trained on the training set using appropriate optimization algorithms and hyperparameters. The validation set is used to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.</li>
  <li>Model Conversion: Once the model is trained and achieves satisfactory accuracy, it is converted to a format compatible with TinyML. TensorFlow Lite is used to convert the model into a lightweight version suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.</li>
  <li>Edge Impulse Integration: The converted model is integrated with the Edge Impulse platform, which provides a user-friendly interface for deploying and testing the model on edge devices.</li>
  <li>Model Deployment: The face emotion recognition model is deployed on a target device, such as a microcontroller or an embedded system, using the TinyML framework. The deployed model can then be used for real-time emotion recognition.</li>
</ol>
